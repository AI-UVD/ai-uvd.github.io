## Engagement Types

AI UVD Limited undertakes work through a small number of clearly defined engagement types.

Each engagement type exists to:
- remove ambiguity
- bound responsibility
- clarify commercial terms
- ensure delivery remains defensible

Work is only undertaken where it fits one of the engagement forms below.

---

## Executive Technical Authority (On-Demand)

This engagement provides time-bounded access to senior applied intelligence capability.

Typically used when:
- decisions must be made under uncertainty
- internal teams need authoritative input
- accountability must remain clear

Characteristics:
- explicitly time-based
- no open-ended advisory
- no implied delivery outside agreed scope

This engagement does not create an employment-like relationship.

---

## Fixed-Scope Delivery

This engagement is used where outcomes can be clearly defined in advance.

Typically used when:
- the problem is sufficiently understood
- success criteria can be stated
- responsibility must be carried through to completion

Characteristics:
- defined scope and deliverables
- agreed milestones or acceptance criteria
- fixed commercial terms

Changes to scope require explicit agreement.

---

## Milestone-Based Execution

This engagement is used where work must progress in controlled stages.

Typically used when:
- complexity is high
- risk must be managed incrementally
- validation is required between stages

Characteristics:
- discrete milestones
- staged commercial commitments
- clear stop / continue decision points

This structure exists to preserve optionality while maintaining discipline.

---

## Stabilisation and Recovery

This engagement is used in situations requiring rapid intervention.

Typically used when:
- delivery is failing
- systems are unstable
- responsibility has become unclear

Characteristics:
- time-critical
- tightly bounded
- focused on restoring control and forward momentum

Long-term work, if any, is contracted separately.

---

## Bounded Ongoing Support

This engagement is used where continuity is required after delivery.

Typically used when:
- systems require oversight
- operational support must remain available
- responsibility must stay defined

Characteristics:
- explicitly bounded
- contractually clear
- reviewed periodically

There is no assumption of permanence or exclusivity.

---

## Engagement discipline

AI UVD Limited does not mix engagement types informally.

Each engagement is:
- explicitly selected
- contractually defined
- commercially clear

If work does not fit an engagement type, it is not undertaken.

## Next steps

Commercial structure, scoping discipline, and engagement boundaries are described in more detail under **How We Engage**.
