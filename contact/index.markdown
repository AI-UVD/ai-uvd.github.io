## Contact

AI UVD Limited accepts a limited number of engagements.

Initial contact is used to determine whether a requirement fits within the company’s engagement model and boundaries.

---

## Before getting in touch

You should contact AI UVD Limited only if:

- you are seeking applied intelligence delivery, not general advice
- the work can be bounded by scope or time
- commercial terms can be agreed explicitly
- you are prepared to engage contractually

Exploratory or speculative enquiries are unlikely to proceed.

---

## What to include

To enable an efficient response, please include:

- a brief description of the requirement
- the context in which the work sits
- any relevant time constraints
- the type of engagement you believe may be appropriate

Not all enquiries are accepted.

---

## Response expectations

AI UVD Limited reviews enquiries deliberately.

If the requirement appears aligned:
- next steps will be proposed
- an appropriate engagement type will be identified

If it is not aligned:
- the enquiry may be declined without further discussion

---

## Alternative routes

AI UVD Limited does not provide general advisory contact or informal consultation.

If you are unsure whether your requirement fits, review the following pages first:

- What We Do  
- Engagement Types
