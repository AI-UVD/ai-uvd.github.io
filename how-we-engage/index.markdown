## How We Engage

AI UVD Limited engages through clear commercial and operational structures.

The intent is to:
- remove ambiguity
- bound responsibility
- preserve independence
- ensure delivery remains defensible

Clarity is preferred over negotiation.

---

## Engagement entry

Work begins only after an engagement has been explicitly defined.

This includes:
- selecting an appropriate engagement type
- defining scope or time boundaries
- agreeing commercial terms
- confirming acceptance criteria where applicable

There is no informal start to work.

---

## Scoping discipline

Engagements are either:

- **explicitly scoped**, or  
- **explicitly time-based**

There is no hybrid or implied arrangement.

Where scope exists:
- deliverables are defined
- responsibilities are bounded
- changes require explicit agreement

Where time exists:
- access is bounded
- expectations are stated
- outcomes are contextual, not guaranteed

---

## Commercial structure

Commercial terms are set to reflect:
- scope and complexity
- delivery risk
- seniority of involvement
- execution overhead
- substitution and resourcing requirements

Billing may include:
- fixed-cost milestones
- staged payments
- time-based billing
- minimum engagement thresholds

AI UVD Limited does not discount authority to win work.

---

## Independence and control

AI UVD Limited operates as an independent supplier.

In practice this means:
- clients contract for outcomes or time access, not individuals
- internal delivery methods remain under AI UVD control
- resourcing decisions are not client-directed
- substitution is available where appropriate

This posture exists to avoid employment-like arrangements.

---

## Acceptance criteria

AI UVD Limited accepts engagements only where:

- responsibility can be bounded
- risk can be contractually managed
- commercial terms are clear
- delivery is structurally safe

Engagements that fail these criteria are declined.

---

## Boundary enforcement

AI UVD Limited does not undertake:
- unpaid discovery
- informal advisory
- speculative work
- open-ended responsibility

These boundaries exist to protect delivery quality and commercial clarity.

Explicit exclusions and non-services are described under **What We Don’t Do**.
