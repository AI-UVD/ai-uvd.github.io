## Company

AI UVD Limited is the operating and billing company used to contract with clients and deliver applied intelligence work.

It exists to:

- contract with clients as the delivery counterparty
- invoice and collect revenue
- deliver explicitly scoped or explicitly time-based engagements
- employ or subcontract execution capacity as required
- absorb operational and delivery risk within the operating layer

AI UVD Limited is the **engine**, not the identity.

---

## Positioning

AI UVD Limited is positioned as:

- a professional operating company
- a delivery and execution vehicle for contracted work
- a commercial interface for engagements and billing
- a container for operational delivery responsibility

It is not positioned as:

- a personal brand
- a thought-leadership platform
- an institutional holding entity
- an open-ended advisory surface

Authority and judgement may originate elsewhere. AI UVD Limited executes and delivers under contract.

---

## Relationship to the wider estate

AI UVD Limited sits beneath the holding layer and operates day to day as an independent delivery company.

The intent is simple:

- commercial activity flows through AI UVD Limited
- delivery responsibility remains bounded and contract-defined
- risk is contained within the operating entity
- strategic ownership and long-term value remain insulated elsewhere

Ownership does not imply day-to-day operational involvement.

---

## Independence posture

AI UVD Limited operates as an independent supplier.

In practice this means:

- the client contracts for deliverables or time access, not employment-like duties
- the company controls internal delivery methods and resourcing
- substitution is available and resourcing decisions remain internal
- exclusivity is not assumed unless explicitly contracted

This posture exists to preserve independence and avoid disguised employment.

---

## Engagement boundaries

AI UVD Limited accepts engagements that are:

- explicitly scoped, **or**
- explicitly time-based

Work must be:

- contractually clear
- commercially defensible
- bounded in responsibility

No informal or implied work is accepted.

---

## Core principle

AI UVD Limited exists to do the work, take the delivery risk, and issue the invoice - so that authority, judgement, and long-term value remain protected elsewhere.
