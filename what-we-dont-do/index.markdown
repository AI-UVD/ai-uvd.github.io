## What We Don’t Do

AI UVD Limited operates with explicit boundaries.

This page exists to state, clearly and without exception, the types of work and arrangements that are not undertaken.

---

## No unpaid discovery or exploratory work

AI UVD Limited does not provide:

- unpaid discovery
- speculative analysis
- informal assessment
- advisory conversations that imply future delivery

All work is contracted before it begins.

---

## No open-ended advisory relationships

AI UVD Limited does not operate as:

- an open-ended advisory function
- a standing consultant without boundaries
- an informal escalation path

If advice is required, it is provided through a defined engagement type with clear terms.

---

## No employment-like arrangements

AI UVD Limited does not accept:

- staff augmentation disguised as consulting
- roles with day-to-day managerial control by the client
- exclusivity without explicit commercial justification

Clients engage the company, not individuals.

---

## No implied responsibility

AI UVD Limited does not accept responsibility for:

- areas outside the agreed scope
- decisions taken without its involvement
- outcomes beyond contractual boundaries

Responsibility exists only where explicitly agreed.

---

## No thought leadership or content work

AI UVD Limited does not exist to:

- publish opinions
- produce marketing content
- act as a public authority surface
- engage in speculative or promotional activity

The focus is execution and delivery.

---

## Boundary integrity

These exclusions are not negotiable.

They exist to:
- preserve delivery quality
- maintain commercial clarity
- avoid structural risk
- ensure engagements remain defensible

If a requirement does not fit within these boundaries, the engagement does not proceed.
